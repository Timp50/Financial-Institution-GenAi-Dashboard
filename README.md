# Financial-Institution-Dashboard
AI-powered feedback analysis dashboard for financial institutions 

#  Dashboard (Demo)

This project was developed by **Timothy Pittman** as a proof of concept for an AI-powered customer feedback dashboard, tailored for financial institutions.

### Project Highlights:
- Uses NLP to analyze customer review sentiment and uncover pain points
- Visualizes feedback trends using word clouds and topic modeling (LDA)
- Includes a simulated Generative AI assistant for executive Q&A use cases
### Prework 
**Data engineer unstructured feedback from multiple sources:**
-App store reviews
-Call center transcripts
-Survey open-ended questions
-Support emails/tickets

### Files:
- `banking_feedback_app.py` – Streamlit dashboard source code
- `customer_reviews.csv` – Sample dataset (simulated)
- `Banking Customer Feedback AI Dashboard Summary.pdf` – 1-page project summary

### Use Case
Large financial institutions like Truist collect massive volumes of unstructured customer feedback — from surveys, app reviews, call transcripts, and support tickets.

**Traditional analytics teams struggle to:**
-Manually synthesize trends across thousands of entries
-Quickly extract themes tied to customer sentiment
-Provide real-time insights to business leaders

**While this prototype simulates a GenAI response, it represents a real use case for LLMs in enterprise banking — helping executives quickly surface insights from unstructured customer feedback. I built this to showcase that vision clearly**
